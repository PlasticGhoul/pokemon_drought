## Story
The base idea is that the region in which the game is playing is facing a climatic catastrophe. There is a big desert in the south of this region which suddenly started to grow to the north.  
Exploring this desert is dangerous and it gets more dangerous the deeper you get into it. Possible dangers are not only weather effects but also strong Pokémon and handicaps for the protagonists team.

### Start
The protagonist (approx. 16 years old) starts in a small town next to the big desert.  
The father of the protagonist is a famous explorer and a well known Pokémon trainer too. He led an expedition into the big desert to investigate the sudden spreading. He is accompanied by a small team of researchers which brings the equipment for experiments and measuring.  
Since a few days however, no reports of the team reached the the base in the town. Because of that, the protagonist decides to go into the fathers room to search for information on how to contact him. He finds a small box with the text "In case of an emergency" on it. In that box the protagonist finds 3 Pokéballs with the starter Pokémon inside them. The protagonist decides to take one of them and travel the region to gather information regarding the desert and the current climatic situation.  
Later in the game the sibling of the protagonist (approx. 11 years old) also decides to take a Pokémon out of the box and is starting to follow the protagonist.
